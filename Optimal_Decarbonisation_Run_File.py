This script presents the mathematical optimisation formulation for an energy planning scenario in a specific geographical region or district.
Renewable energy and fossil-based sources make up the power generation in a specific geographical region or district. 
Each period consists of its respective energy demand and CO2 emission limit.
EP-NETs and EC-NETs may be utilised to achieve the CO2 emission limit for each period.
This energy planning mathematical formulation may be optimised subject to either a mininum cost or minimum emission objective function.
